 * @title TimelockController
 * @dev This file includes the import of the TimelockController contract from OpenZeppelin.
 *
 * The TimelockController contract is used to enforce a time delay on the execution of
 * governance actions, enhancing security by allowing stakeholders to react before
 * changes are implemented. It is typically utilized in decentralized governance systems
 * to schedule and execute transactions after a predefined delay.
 *
 * This file does not define any additional contracts or functions of its own.
 * It solely serves to import the TimelockController contract.
